------------------
* Merge pull request `#12 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_localization/issues/12>`_ from clearpathrobotics/CORE-2288-catch-lock-error
  Waiting for worker thread to join main thread before destroying the object.
* Waiting for worker thread to join main thread before destroying the object.
* Merge pull request `#11 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_localization/issues/11>`_ from clearpathrobotics/check_can_transform_odom_base_link
  Check that odom->base_link transform is available
* Check that odom->base_link transform is available
  This silence the ERROR log msg that happens if the odom->base_link
  transform isn't available later in the code, in cases where the odom
  broadcaster is still starting/warming up.
* Merge pull request `#10 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_localization/issues/10>`_ from clearpathrobotics/add_high_covariance_volume_check
  Add high covariance volume delta check
* Add test script for input covariance
* Add covariance (delta) volume check
  This also silence the check for the large covariance check on single
  covariance elements, which reports harmless warning in some case, e.g.
  pure wheel (pose) odometry which grows without bounds but it's a normal
  and intended behaviour
* Merge pull request `#9 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_localization/issues/9>`_ from clearpathrobotics/CHECC-196-tf-param
  Adding parameter to make transform publishing optional
* Fixing catch statement for failed tf lookup
* Adding printout of new parameter
* Adding parameter to make transform publishing optional
* Merge pull request `#8 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_localization/issues/8>`_ from clearpathrobotics/remove_qtcreator_file
